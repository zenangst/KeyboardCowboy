          <h3>Group your workflows to make them contextual.</h3>
          <p>
          A group is a container of workflows. Groups can be scoped to only be active when a certain criteria is met, such as having a specific application active and being the front-most application.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          To create a new group, simply use the built-in keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘N or use
          the `Add Group` button in the lower left corner.
          </p>
          
          <p>New groups are declared as global, to scope them to only apply in a certain context, simply click the elipsis that appears when you hover the newly created group.

          <h3>Have one keystroke fire of your workflow.</h3>
          <p>
          A workflow is a composition of a collection of keyboard shortcuts that correspond to one or many commands that will run in sequence.
          </p>



          <p>You can create workflows that contain a target action, like switching or opening applications. Or run entire workflows like opening all your work-related applications as soon as you arrive at work.</p>

          <p>Perhaps you are switching between design time and development time, then two separate workflows for jumping between contexts might suite you.

          <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
          <h3>One keystroke or emacs bindings, it is all up to you.</h3>
          <p>
          A workflow can be triggered by one or a sequence of shortcuts. It could either be a single key or a key with one or more modifiers. </p>

          <p>
          But we didn't stop there, you can also combine multiple sequences of keyboard shortcuts to use cluster your shortcuts under one leading key.

          <h3>Have one keystroke fire of your workflow.</h3>
          <p>The best keyboard shortcut is that one that you don't have to invoke</p>
          <p>Keyboard Cowboy supports adding contextual application triggers, which means that you can run workflows depending on your current system state</p>
          <p>For example, if you want to open applications as a bundle:<br/>
          When you launch your editor, you want Terminal and your documentation tool to also open. As an added bonus, you can also have the same bundle mirrored so when you are done with work, the bundled applications will close when you close the editor.
          </p>
          <p>The new way to ensure that your Mac always have resources available depending on your current needs.

          <h2>Commands</h2>
          <p>
          Think about commands as plain instruction that macOS should carry out. It can be opening or activating an application, open a file, folder or web page. Or if you want to do something more advanced, you can do this by running Apple- or Shellscripts. 
           The real power lies inside combining commands together and making them contextual. Context is added on the group level so that you can keep your context tidy and on point.

        <h2 class="foreground-red">Core Foundation</h2>
        <p>
        We didn’t want to hold back when packing the applications with incredible power, but like Uncle Ben so wisely said; “With great power comes great responsibility”. This led us to decide very early on that we needed a unique development process when building an application that monitors key strokes.
        <br/><br/> Keyboard Cowboy should therefor have a transparent development process and be 100% open source, readily available for anyone that wants to dig into the nitty gritty details. <br/><br/>

        The motivation behind monitoring rather than registering listeners came from the idea that you could rebind your keys to do what ever you like in any given context. It could be re-mapping ⌥W,⌥A,⌥S,⌥D keys to work as your arrow keys or spark new life into the fn-key by using it as a modifier for your keyboard shortcuts. This simply was not possible with global listeners. <br/>
        
        We also wrote down the following application definition which can be interpreted as our core values:<br/>
        
        <ul>
          <li><b class="foreground-purple">Composable</b>: The user should be able to compose workflows that fit their needs</li>
          <li><b class="foreground-pink">Open</b>: as in open source, it should be distributed freely without any fees or other costs</li>
          <li><b class="foreground-yellow">Responsive</b>: it needs to be lighting fast, never blocking the user from achieving the task at hand</li>
          <li><b class="foreground-orange">Easy</b>: to use and customize, with a UI familiar to both novice and expert users</li>
          <li><b class="foreground-red">Secure</b>: we should never track, log or store anything related to the users I/O</li>
        </ul>
        
        The application is written in Swift and uses the latest SwiftUI additions to render the applications user interface.

        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <h3>
        The application is completely free.</h2>

        <p>
        If you have a dying urge to pay for software, you can always donate to one of the developers to ensure that the application keep getting updates. However, this is totally up to you.
        </p>

        <p>
        We eat our own dogfood and intend to keep the application up-to-date and best in class when it comes to being a keyboard shortcut manager for macOS.
