### **Keyboard Cowboy**: the missing keyboard shortcut utility for macOS

- **composable** the user should be able to compose workflows that fit their needs
- **open** as in open source, it should be distributed freely without any fees or other costs
- **responsive** it needs to be lighting fast, never blocking the user from achieving the task at hand
- **easy** to use and customize, with a UI familiar to both novice and expert users
- **secure** we should never track, log or store anything related to the users I/O
